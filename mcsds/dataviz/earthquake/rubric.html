<h3>
Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure as stated by the essay?
</h3>
<p>
This presentation follows the Interactive Slideshow visualization model.  I am able to tell a story about the amount of earthquakes and where they happen both in the United States as well around the world.  Each slide with a map is drawn using D3 and updates the data as it loads.  The final slide allows users to show where the non-earthquakes are as well as the earthquakes detected in the United States.
</p>
<h3>
Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?
</h3>
<p>
Each Scene follows a standard look and feel.  It uses the same background and same font sizes for headers throughout the scenes. The slideshow is generated by reveal.js with D3 providing the data documents throughout.  Using similar css throughout provides a common theme as the user proceeds through the presentation.

The design of the presentation was to show each set of data like it was a dialoge and if I was up on stage showing it to others. Each section of the presentation provides a set of data and then a bit of explaination or context to allow the user to move to the next slide.  Each of them ar tied together providing an unified theme.
</p>
<h3>
Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?
</h3>
<p>
There are many annotations throughout the presentation. The first annonation comes with the first graph as it has an automatic slider bar that shows the last 24 hours of earthquakes.  It describes the time the event happens as well as lights up the circles to the respective locations.
<br/>
The second set of annonations come in the Non-Earthquake slide.  This slide shows that there are powerful events that happen around the United States in particular that register as earthquakes.  Users can hover over each event and find the strength of the event as well as the type of event.  The different types can include Ice Quakes, Chemical Explosions, and Quarry Explosions to name just a few.
<br/>
The third set of annonations follow the same with the Non-Earthquake, but allow the user to see the same data for all events.  This includes earthquakes as well as non-earthquakes.
</p>
<h3>
Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?
</h3>
<p>
Parameters to control a graph appears on the third slide.  The user is given a choice to select seeing all earthquakes or seeing just the non-earthquakes.  Based on that selection, the graph will change to show circles of events around the United States. It will also update the event data for each data-point with the size and type of event.

</p>
<h3>
Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?
</h3>
<p>
Triggers and parameters go hand-in-hand.  As users change the parameters in the third graph, this triggers the data to change on the graph to show the correct data points.  These events are communicated to the users by asking them to select one of the radio buttons on the page to see which set of data that interests them.  Once it is selected that event fires off a query to d3 to let it know that the DOM has changed and that data needs to be recalculated.
